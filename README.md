# Venatio

A project made for NASA ADC 2025. Made with p5.js, React, and React Native.

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Create an app visualizing the flight path of Artemis II and indicating which of SCaN’s antennas are available to communicate with Earth in real time.
**Duration**: 10 weeks, starting October 2, 2024, and ending December 11, 2024. ​

## App Creation
1. **Mission Path**: Display the path of Artemis II by processing and visualizing all provided position and velocity data. ​
2. **Color Utilization**: Use color to represent different mission phases (orbiting Earth, traveling to the Moon, returning to Earth), number of available antennas, and resultant velocity vector. ​
3. **Antenna Data**: Use the Link budget formula and SCaN antenna data to display a prioritized list of antennas with line-of-sight access to Artemis II. ​


## Our Project
Venatio uses p5.js, a 2d/3d renderer to accurately display the Artemis II mission.

## About Nasa ADC
The NASA App Development Challenge (ADC) is a coding challenge for middle and high school students to develop a software application supporting NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Team. ​ The challenge is part of NASA’s Next-Gen STEM initiative and aims to engage students in deep space exploration missions, particularly the Artemis program. ​
